    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My name is Avinash Singh Munda, and I am an enthusiastic beginner in the field of technology. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Application degree, which provides me with a strong academic foundation in computer science.

        As I embark on this journey, I am particularly interested in UI/UX design. Although I am still in the early stages of learning, I am dedicated to acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Through self-learning resources, online tutorials, and practice projects, I am gradually honing my abilities and gaining hands-on experience.
        
        Additionally, I have recently started freelancing in web development. This exciting opportunity allows me to apply my budding skills and knowledge to real-world projects. It not only helps me further enhance my technical expertise but also provides valuable insights into client requirements and expectations.
        
        While UI/UX design and web development are my primary areas of focus, I am also beginning to explore the field of DevOps engineering. I am fascinated by the idea of bridging the gap between development and operations, and I am eager to learn more about automation, continuous integration, and deployment.
        
        As a beginner, my commitment to continuous learning is unwavering. I actively seek opportunities to grow my skills, stay updated with the latest industry trends, and apply my knowledge in practical scenarios. Through this journey, I aim to build a strong foundation that will pave the way for my future growth and success.</p>
